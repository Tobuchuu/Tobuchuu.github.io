            Chinese food is widespread and famous which means that even you should have come across a few selections. 
            Such as Hotpot (火锅 huǒguō), Dumplings (饺子 jiǎozi), and Sweet and sour pork (糖醋里脊 tángcù lǐjǐ). 
            Food has a special place for chinese people’s daily lives and some believe that eating good food can bring 
            harmony and closure with family and relationships. It expresses but also establishes relationships between 
            people and their environment, as well as their beliefs.
