                    Taoism is a Chinese religion with a history dating back more than 1,700 years.
                    Lao Tzu founded it, and the teachings are based on his writings about the Tao or Way.

                    is a fundamental depiction of Taoist beliefs. It represents the balance of dark and light.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Christianity made its way to China very early and rapidly developed in 1840 after
                    the Sino-British Opium War. The number and influence of Chinese Catholic and Christian
                    communities rose across the country. The religion took some time to get a solid footing
                    in China, but it is now firmly entrenched.
