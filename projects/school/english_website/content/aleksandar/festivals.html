    <h2>Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year/Spring festival)</h2>

    <p>This is the most important festival to the Chinese that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar.
        The Chinese New Year starts on the second new moon after the winter solstice which falls on the 12th of February 2021. But why is it called the
        Spring Festival despite most of China celebrating it during winter? 
        <br><br>
        Because it starts from the Beginning of Spring in correlation to the lunisolar calendar (the first of the twenty-four solar
        terms in coordination with the changes of Nature) and marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring. (A solar term is any of twenty-four
        periods in traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar that matches a particular astronomical event or signifies some natural phenomenon as seen below)

    <p>The Spring Festival marks a new year on the lunar calendar and represents the desire for a new life. It is also a time to honor deities and ancestors
        together with family and friends to celebrate the new year in their own way.

    <h2>Lantern Festival</h2>
    <p>The (Spring) Lantern Festival is a Chinese festival celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month in the Chinese Calendar which falls on the 26th
        of February 2021.Usually falling in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar (the common calendar that has 365.25 days per year) and is the final
        day of the Chinese new years celebrations. During the Lantern Festival, children go out at night carrying paper lanterns which are often made in the form of
        animals and solve riddles on the lanterns before sending them away. The lanterns can symbolize the people letting go of their past selves and becoming their
        new better selves.
